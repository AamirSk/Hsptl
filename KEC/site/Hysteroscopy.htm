                                    appropriate for some patients. A doctor who specializes in this procedure will consult

                                    stay in the hospital. However, in certain circumstances, such as if your doctor
                                    is concerned about your reaction to anesthesia, an overnight stay may be required.</small>

                                    to be observed for several hours before going home. After the procedure, you may
                                    have some cramping or slight vaginal bleeding for one to two days. In addition,
                                    you may feel shoulder pain if gas was used during your hysteroscopy. It is also
                                    not unusual to feel somewhat faint or sick. However, if you experience any of the
                                    following symptoms, be sure to contact your doctor:<br />

                                        could be a problem with their womb. Symptoms can include:

                                            <li>heavy periods or irregular periods</li>

                                        It can be performed under local anaesthetic (when medication is used to numb a small
                                        area) or general anaesthetic (when you are asleep during the procedure), depending
                                        on the reason for your hysteroscopy.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The surgeon will use a device called a speculum to open up the walls of the vagina,
                                        in the same way it is used during a cervical smear test. The surgeon will then insert
                                        the hysteroscope through the cervix, into the womb.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Gas or fluid is often used to inflate the womb, to give the surgeon a better view.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        If a biopsy or treatment is needed, such as the removal of polyps, other instruments
                                        will be passed into the womb.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        A hysteroscopy usually takes between 10 and 30 minutes, depending on what needs
                                        to be done.</p>

                                        Compared with other, more invasive procedures, hysteroscopy may provide the following
                                        advantages:</p>
                                    <ul>

                                        <li>Less pain medication needed after surgery</li>

                                    <p>
                                        Hysteroscopy is a relatively safe procedure. However, as with any type of surgery,
                                        complications are possible. With hysteroscopy, complications occur in less than
                                        1 percent of cases and can include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Risks associated with anesthesia</li>
                                        <li>Infection</li>
                                        <li>Heavy bleeding</li>
                                        <li>Injury to the cervix, uterus, bowel or bladder</li>
                                    </ul>

                                            had an anaesthetic, you may have to stay in hospital until it has worn off.</b></p>

                                        When you get home, rest as much as possible. Some women experience cramping afterwards
                                        that is similar to period pain. You may also get shoulder pain – a result of the
                                        gas or fluid used to inflate your womb. Any cramps or pain should pass within a
                                        few days. You can take painkillers in the meantime.</p>

                                        Most women feel they can return to normal activities, such as work, the day after
                                        having a hysteroscopy. However, you may wish to have a few days off to rest. The
                                        amount of time you need will depend on if you had additional treatment at the same
                                        time (for example, to remove fibroids or polyps).</p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you are undergoing treatment at the same time as your hysteroscopy, you will
                                        probably experience some bleeding afterwards. Should this happen, you may find it
                                        helpful to wear a sanitary towel until it wears off.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even if you are not having treatment at the same time as your hysteroscopy, you
                                        may still experience some vaginal bleeding and discharge. This is normal and should
                                        pass in a few days, although it can last for several weeks.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        You shouldn't use tampons for at least a month after having a hysteroscopy, as this
                                        will help reduce the risk of infection.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you have had a general anaesthetic, avoid drinking alcohol and driving a car
                                        for at least 24 hours.</p><br />

                                        Your surgeon may give you your hysteroscopy results immediately if it is to explore
                                        conditions such as polyps or fibroids.

                                        If a biopsy is needed, it can take between two and six weeks to get your results.
